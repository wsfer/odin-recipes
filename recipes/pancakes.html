        <p>Do you like to make pancakes on the weekend? Perfect for a late breakfast or for brunch, these tender pancakes are topped and garnished with chopped walnuts. The sauce may be made the night before, if you like. Simply cover and refrigerate, then warm up while the pancakes cook. Depending on the size of the griddle, this makes a batch of 4 or 6 pancakes. </p>
